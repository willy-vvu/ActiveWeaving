# Active Weaving

Working with the [Self Assembly Lab](http://www.selfassemblylab.net), I explored how to fabricate textiles and woven materials that change shape under different environmental conditions. With such a material, different behaviors can be "programmed" by changing the underlying patterns and geometries used in the weaving process.
